  <p>
    You have found my personal website, created using Jekyll and hosted on Github. For those looking to get into contact with me for professional reasons, feel free to refer to the other pages on this site for more information. In the future, I plan on filling this site with actually noticeable amounts of content. Until then, here is an incomplete list of things I like: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li >Drawing</li>
    <li >Reading</li>
    <li >Music (playing and listening!)</li>
    <li >Hiking</li>
    <li >Animals</li>
    <li >Spicy food</li>
    <li >Chocolate milk</li>
    <li >Jackets with inside pockets</li>
    <li >Kirkland version of Smartwool socks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Thanks for visiting!
